## Project Description

Demonstrate how middleware can be used with the Nitric framework to intercept requests for validation or auth.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install Nitric

Follow the steps in the [installation guide](https://nitric.io/docs/installation)

### Step 2: Run your Nitric project locally

```bash
yarn install
nitric start
```

### Step 3: Test the API

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:4001/hello'
```

Check your log files for the following output:

```text

This is  your main function running ...
```

## About Nitric

[Nitric](https://nitric.io) is a framework for rapid development of cloud-native and serverless applications. Define your apps in terms of the resources they need, then write the code for serverless function based APIs, event subscribers and scheduled jobs.

Apps built with Nitric can be deployed to AWS, Azure or Google Cloud all from the same code base so you can focus on your products, not your cloud provider.

Nitric makes it easy to:

- Create smart serverless functions and APIs
- Build reliable distributed apps that use events and/or queues
- Securely store and retrieve secrets
- Read and write files from buckets
