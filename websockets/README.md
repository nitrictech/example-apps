## Project Description

A basic back-end for a messaging app. Useful as a functioning WebSocket example that you can use as a foundation for more advanced applications.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install Nitric

Follow the steps in the [installation guide](https://nitric.io/docs/installation)

### Step 2: Run your Nitric project locally

```bash
yarn install
nitric start
```

### Step 3: Test the API

Using your favourite Websocket tool such as Postman, connect to your Websocket endpoint, by default this is - ws://localhost:4001

Then simply send messages from multiple client connections.

## About Nitric

[Nitric](https://nitric.io) is a framework for rapid development of cloud-native and serverless applications. Define your apps in terms of the resources they need, then write the code for serverless function based APIs, event subscribers and scheduled jobs.

Apps built with Nitric can be deployed to AWS, Azure or Google Cloud all from the same code base so you can focus on your products, not your cloud provider.

Nitric makes it easy to:

- Create smart serverless functions and APIs
- Build reliable distributed apps that use events and/or queues
- Securely store and retrieve secrets
- Read and write files from buckets
