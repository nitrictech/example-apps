# Nitric Examples

Example applications with the Nitric Framework demonstrating 'Infrastructure in code'.

Here you'll find examples writen with various languages including python and typescript. Each example can be deployed with Nitric for AWS, GCP and Azure or run locally.

> Note: Refer to the README of each project for setup instructions and more info as sometimes they are reliant on cloud services.

The projects are created with our latest version `v1`.
